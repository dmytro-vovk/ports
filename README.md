# Microservices Test Assignment

Packages
* `services/protocol` -- contains definitions of common types and generated code.
* `services/rest-api-server` -- front REST service with main function and docker file.
* `services/storage-api-server` -- storage services with GRPC interface, consisting of main function and docker file.


# Testing and usage

Tests consist of unit and integration ones. In order to run the full set of tests use `make` command. 

Other helpful make commands:
* `codegen` -- runs code generation for GRPC related functionality.
* `lint` -- runs go linter.
* `test` -- runs unit & integration tests.
* `coverage` -- reads generated by the `test` target coverage file and updates the badge at the top of this file.
* `clean` -- removes temporary files.

Default target runs `lint test coverage clean`.
